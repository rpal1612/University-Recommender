## 🎯 Overview

Choosing the right graduate university is one of the most critical decisions for students pursuing higher education. This intelligent recommendation system demonstrates an AI-powered approach to university matching using **weighted similarity algorithms** and **multi-criteria filtering**.

### **Key Highlights:**
- 🤖 **Smart weighted scoring** algorithm (Academic 60%, Language 10%, Budget/Location 20%, Other factors 10%)
- 🎨 **Modern, responsive UI** with beautiful animations and fallback recommendations
- 🔍 **Comprehensive filtering system** with 8 countries and multiple criteria
- 🔗 **Instant Google search** integration for each university
- ⚡ **Performance optimized** with data segmentation by GRE scores
- 🌍 **International coverage** with 54 top universities from 8 countries
- 💡 **Smart fallback system** - Shows alternative matches based on GRE & budget when strict criteria yield few results

**Real Data**: 27,000 entries covering top universities from USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Singapore, and Switzerland with diverse program options.

## 🧠 Algorithm & Methodology

### **Weighted Similarity Scoring System**

The recommendation engine uses a sophisticated **hybrid approach** combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with feature-weighted scoring:

#### **1. Data Segmentation (Performance Optimization)**
Universities are pre-segmented by total GRE scores for faster searching:
```
- Low (260-290): 0 universities
- Below Average (290-310): 1,292 universities
- Average (310-320): 9,379 universities
- Above Average (320-330): 12,209 universities
- High (330-340): 4,120 universities
- Excellent (340+): 0 universities
```

#### **2. Multi-Criteria Filtering**
Hard filters eliminate non-matching universities based on:
- Country preference
- Budget constraints
- University type
- Maximum world ranking
- Program duration
- Language requirements
- Special preferences (research/internship/visa)

#### **3. Weighted Similarity Score Calculation**

For each remaining university, a similarity score (0-1) is calculated:

**📊 Academic Match (60% weight)**
```python
similarity = 1 - (|user_score - uni_score| / score_range)
academic_score = avg(GRE_V_sim, GRE_Q_sim, GRE_W_sim, CGPA_sim) × 0.60
```

**🌐 Language Proficiency (10% weight)**
```python
language_score = 1 - (|user_score - uni_min| / max_score) × 0.10
```

**💰 Budget & Location (20% weight)**
```python
country_match = 1.0 if match else 0.3
budget_match = 1 - (|uni_tuition - budget_mid| / budget_mid)
location_score = (country_match + budget_match) / 2 × 0.20
```

**🏆 Other Factors (10% weight)**
```python
ranking_bonus = 1 - (ranking / 500)
experience_bonus = work_exp > 2 ? 0.2 : 0
publications_bonus = has_publications ? 0.2 : 0
preferences_bonus = matches(research, internship, visa)
other_score = sum(bonuses) × 0.10
```

**🎯 Final Score**
```python
Total_Score = academic_score + language_score + location_score + other_score
```

#### **4. Ranking & Selection**
- Universities sorted by total similarity score (descending)
- Top 5 unique universities selected
- **Smart Country Filter**: NEVER ignores country preference - always respects your selection
- **Intelligent Fallback**: If < 5 matches found with all criteria:
  - Shows perfect matches first (purple cards)
  - Adds alternative matches based on GRE scores & budget (orange cards with "Alternative Match" badge)
  - Clear messaging explains the distinction
- Ensures diverse recommendations with no duplicates

### **Algorithm Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n = filtered universities
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for score storage
- **Average Processing Time**: < 200ms for typical query
